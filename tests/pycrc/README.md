Copyright of the generated source code
======================================

Prior to v0.6, pycrc was released under the GPL and an additional addition to
the licence was required to permit to use the generated source code in products
with a OSI unapproved licence. As of version 0.6, pycrc is released under the
terms of the MIT licence and such an additional clause to the licence is no
more required.
The code generated by pycrc is not considered a substantial portion of the
